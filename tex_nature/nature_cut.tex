\maketitle

\textbf{Summary.} We present operational limits for retrocausal resources: Loop-DPI bounds loop information gain by $-\log \Ps$ bits per attempt; a thermodynamic Entropy Ledger prices paradox resolution at $kT\,D_{\mathrm{KL}}$. Single-shot converses and multi-loop cut-sets are provided, with experimental proposals and an operational metaphysics framing.

\section*{Main}
We formalize a heralded retro-map within a CPTP circuit. The Loop-DPI stems from a Radon--Nikodym bound on the success-conditioned measure. The Entropy Ledger follows from I-projection and nonequilibrium work relations. Empirically, heralded photonics and ion-trap protocols can chart the Pareto between temporal advantage and entropy debt.
