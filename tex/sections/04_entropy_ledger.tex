Let $P_{\text{hist}}$ denote a prior measure over histories and let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of Novikov-consistent histories. Define
\[
P_{\text{hist}}^\star \;\in\; \arg\min_{Q\in\mathcal{C}} \KL(P_{\text{hist}}\Vert Q).
\]
\begin{theorem}[Entropy tax for paradox resolution]
The minimal heat dissipation needed to enforce consistency by minimally perturbing the history distribution is
\[
\mathsf{ED}_{\min} \;\ge\; kT\,\KL\!\big(P_{\text{hist}}\;\Vert\;P_{\text{hist}}^\star\big).
\]
\end{theorem}
This follows from standard thermodynamic inequalities (Landauer) and the fact that changing distributions by a KL amount requires at least $kT$ times that KL in work, on average.
