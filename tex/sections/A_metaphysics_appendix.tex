We model the space of histories as a measurable space $(\mathcal{H},\mathcal{F})$ with prior $P_{\text{hist}}$. Consistency corresponds to an I-projection onto a feasible set $\mathcal{C}$.

\paragraph{Identity.} Let $\sigma_t$ denote a ``personal'' state evolving under morphisms $U_{t\to s}$. A retro-intervention imposes a fixed-point constraint $U_{t\to s}U_{s\to t}\sigma_t=\sigma_t$. When consistency requires redistributing probability mass over narratives, the minimum change is quantified by the Entropy Ledger.

\paragraph{Free Will (Operational).} Define $\mathsf{Free}(t):=H(A_t\mid \text{Past},\text{Ledger Info})$. Retro-resources can reduce $\mathsf{Free}$ but only by paying scarcity ($-\log\Ps$) or heat ($\mathsf{ED}$). Thus there is ``no free chronology'': influence against the arrow is always priced.
