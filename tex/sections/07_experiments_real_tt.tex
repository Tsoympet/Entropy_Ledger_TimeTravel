\section{Experiments and ``Real'' Time Travel Pathways}
\subsection{Photonic and Ion-Trap Protocols}
We propose heralded postselection using linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters, single-photon detectors) and ion-trap ancilla-based postselection. We measure $(\Ps,\Delta I_{\circlearrowleft})$ directly from bit-coded experiments and estimate $\mathsf{ED}$ via dissipated heat proxies on the heralding arm.

\subsection{Operational Real Time Travel}
\paragraph{Relativistic Time Dilation (Forward Travel).} Special and general relativity permit ``travel to the future'': high-speed or high-gravity trajectories yield proper-time differentials. This is experimentally supported (e.g., GPS clock corrections). Our framework treats this as a \emph{forward-only} chronology resource with $\mathsf{ED}\approx 0$ but nontrivial energetic cost.

\paragraph{Laboratory Retrocausality (Effective Backward Influence).} Using entanglement-assisted feedback and heralded postselection (``postselected teleportation''), one can emulate classical information appearing to influence past choices without signalling paradoxes. Here, $\Ps\ll 1$ and the Loop-DPI applies: each additional bit of apparent retro-information requires exponentially rarer successful trials, and the Entropy Ledger quantifies the thermodynamic footprint of enforcing consistency.
