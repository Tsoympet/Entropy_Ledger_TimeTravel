\section{Introduction}
Time travel captivates both science and metaphysics. We consider an operational setting where \emph{effective} retrocausality is implemented by postselected channels with success probability $\Ps\in(0,1]$. Rather than invoking ontological paradoxes, we ask: \emph{What are the tight information-theoretic and thermodynamic limits when a single retrocausal edge is available inside a causal circuit?}

Our contributions are:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=0.2em]
    \item A resource theory of time travel with free operations, monotones, distillation, and composition laws.
    \item Loop-DPI: an information inequality that upper-bounds the net loop information gain by $-\log \Ps$ (bits), with finite-accuracy correction.
    \item An \emph{Entropy Ledger}: the minimum heat dissipation needed to restore Novikov consistency equals $kT\,\KL(P\Vert P^\star)$ where $P^\star$ is the I-projection of the prior history measure $P$ onto the consistency set.
    \item Multi-loop cut-set bounds and a single-shot strong converse.
    \item Experimental protocols in photonics and ion-traps; a roadmap to \emph{real} time travel in practice: (i) relativistic time dilation for forward travel, and (ii) laboratory retrocausal emulation via heralded postselection and entanglement-assisted feedback.
\end{itemize}
