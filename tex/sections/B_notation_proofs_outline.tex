\section{Notation and Proof Outlines}
\paragraph{Loop-DPI sketch.} Normalize the non-TP retro-map $\Pi$ by conditioning on the heralded outcome. Apply a change-of-measure argument around the cycle and bound the Radon--Nikodym derivative by $1/\Ps$, yielding $\Delta I_{\circlearrowleft}\le -\log \Ps$ (bits). Finite accuracy adds a $-\log(1-\varepsilon)$ term.

\paragraph{Entropy Ledger sketch.} Consistency is enforced by projecting $P_{\text{hist}}$ onto $\mathcal{C}$ in KL. The work cost of modifying distributions obeys $\langle W\rangle\ge kT\,\KL(P\Vert P^\star)$ by Landauer and nonequilibrium work relations.
